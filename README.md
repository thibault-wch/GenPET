# GenPET Enables Multi-tracer PET Synthesis towards Large-scale AD Screening
This is a code implementation of **GenPET** proposed in the manuscript "**GenPET Enables Multi-tracer PET Synthesis towards Large-scale Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Screening**".

Note that we have opened [**multi-thread preprocessing**](https://github.com/thibault-wch/A-Unified-3D-Cross-Modality-Synthesis-Codebase/tree/main/preprocess) and [**evaluation**](https://github.com/thibault-wch/A-Unified-3D-Cross-Modality-Synthesis-Codebase/tree/main/evaluation) codes in the previous [**repository**](https://github.com/thibault-wch/A-Unified-3D-Cross-Modality-Synthesis-Codebase).

## Todos
* [X] ~~Publish the **multi-thread preprocessing code** for **3D MRI and PET brain images**~~.
* [X] ~~Publish **3D evaluation methods (MAE, SSIM, etc)**.~~
* [X] ~~Publish **subject ids of the ADNI database** used in our project.~~
* [ ] Publish **modality discriminative model** codes.
* [ ] Publish **3D unified latent VAE** codes.
* [ ] Publish **latent diffusion transformer** codes.
* [ ] Publish **comparative methods** in a unified codebase for better reproducibility.
* [ ] Optimize the **README.md** and **related information**.
